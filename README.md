# fastl

WORK IN PROGRESS - Currently building the proper toolset to properly develop a good fast compiling API

C++ STL subset with faster compile times. Get the best times while iterating on features while getting all the performance from the real STL when compiling your release builds. A preprocessor define choses to use FASTL naive implementations or the real STL.
